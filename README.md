# Coffee_Sales_Data_Visualization_Project

In this project, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard to effectively visualize coffee sales data. The data collection phase involved using XLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH functions to gather detailed customer information (including names, emails, and countries) and product data (such as coffee types, roast types, unit prices, and profits). These functions ensured the completeness and accuracy of the Orders Table. I also used a multiplication formula to calculate sales and implemented multiple IF functions to convert abbreviations to full coffee type and roast type names.

To ensure clarity and avoid confusion between European and American date formats, I standardized the date formats and clearly labeled package sizes (e.g., 1 kilo, 0.5 kilo). I formatted the unit price and sales columns in USD. Data cleansing was critical, and I eliminated duplicates to maintain data integrity.

I then converted the data range into a table, facilitating easy updates and automatic refreshes when new data is added. Creating pivot tables and charts was a significant step. I built a pivot table for total sales and inserted a line chart to visualize sales over time by coffee type. For enhanced interactivity, I incorporated a timeline for dynamic date filtering and added slicers for roast type, size, and loyalty card status. Additionally, I replicated the worksheet to create pivot tables and bar charts for sales by country and the top five customers.

Finally, I designed the dashboard layout meticulously, aligning elements using the Alt key to ensure a professional and neat appearance. By interconnecting all visuals, the dashboard allowed for seamless data manipulation and provided clear, interactive insights. This comprehensive, step-by-step approach ensured the development of a user-friendly coffee sales dashboard, showcasing my proficiency in data visualization and Excel functionalities.
